## A Landing page two week after landing a new city

It was december 2021 our team was assigned to create a landing page. We did some research and I created some samples to decide for a color pallet.

Our CEO liked those samples, and then assinged the whole landing page project to me, and said "I totally trust your taste. Design it and send it to me."

Just few days before my one way flight to Vancouver. I was moving to Vancouver then, ans I was moving alone.

Our agency was WEB3 and NFT agency, so it needed a landing page with those sick crazy wibes of NFTs. It couldn't be boring about us page. And at the same time I was moving to Vancouver, alone.

So, I asked for more time and landed in Vancouver, and get setteled in my new place, which basically an empty suit. No desk. No chair.

I got one these and started woking!

Two weeks later I delivered the ladning page.

In this two weeks I worked with Framer Motion.

Any way here is the end result.

So, it needs to be avangaurd and crazy!
